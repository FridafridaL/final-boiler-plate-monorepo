      <p>
        We are a group of four women who attend Technigos Web developer boot
        camp during the fall 2023. We are all pretty new to coding and this is
        our final project during this boot camp. After some brain storming
        together we eventually came up with this idea - a <i> Whisper wall </i>
        where the users can both read others stories and also post their own
        stories. The stories can be both old legends and tales, but also funny
        stories that has happened today. We wanted to connect the stories to a
        map so the users can find new places to visit based on where "the good
        stories" are, but also so the user can choose stories from a certain
        city.
        <br /> <br />
        We really hope that you will enjoy this web page just as much as we do!
        And please, if you have a story to tell -
        <i> share it with the rest of us! â™¥ </i>
